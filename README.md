# Module-13-Challenge

## Description

- This code displays an E-commerce Back End.
- I wanted to create and test the api routes on the back end of an inventory database.
- I coded JavaScript using MySQL, Sequelize, Express, and Node. I tested the api routes with Insomnia (although I would prefer an in-editor extension like Thunder Client).
- Given more time I would include concise comments, more detailed error messages, and thorough tests.
